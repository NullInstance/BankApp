# BankApp

There is a NestJS backend server in server and a React frontend in client.

On the same machine deploy both, run `npm install` in each respective folder, and
then you can run `npm run start` for both services.

After doing this, navigate on your browser to `http://localhost:8000` to view
the front end.
